\section*{Question 1 (50 points): Biology}
\vspace{.25cm}
\noindent Load in the data labelled \texttt{cholesterol.csv} on GitHub, which contains an observational study of 315 observations.

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	Response variable: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{cholCat}: 1 if the individual has high cholesterol; 0 if the individual does not have high cholesterol
	\end{itemize}
	\item
	Explanatory variables: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		\texttt{sex}: 1 Male; 0 Female
		\item
		\texttt{fat}: grams of fat consumed per day
		
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\noindent Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	We are interested in predicting the cholesterol category based on sex and fat intake.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item
		Fit an additive model. Provide the summary output, the global null hypothesis, and $p$-value. Please describe the results and provide a conclusion.
		\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=38, lastline=43]{PS6_Answers.R}

			\centering
			\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{summary output.png}
			\caption{Summary Output}
			\label{}
		\end{figure}
	
		The summary of the linear model shows that the global null hypothesis is rejected, as the individual null hypotheses for B0 = 0, B1 = 0, B2 = 0 are all rejected since the p-value is less than the alpha value of 0.05. According to the linear model, males are more likely to have higher cholestrol since the coefficient attached to the sex variable is 0.189. Moreover, higher fat intake contributes to higher cholestrol since the coefficient attached to the fat variable is 0.008. Therefore, an individual's sex and fat intake are related to the cholestrol category of the individual.
		
		%\item
		%How many iterations did it take to find the maximum likelihood estimates?
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item
	If explanatory variables are significant in this model, then
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item
		For women, how does increasing their fat intake by 1 gram per day change their odds on being in the high cholesterol group? (Interpretation of a coefficient)
		
		
		Based on the coefficient, increasing fat intake by 1 gram per day for women increases their odds of being in the high cholestrol group by 0.008.
		\item
		
		For men, how does increasing their fat intake by 1 gram per day change their odds on being in the high cholesterol group? (Interpretation of a coefficient)
		
		
		Based on the coefficient, increasing fat intake by 1 gram per day for men increases their odds of being in the high cholestrol group by 0.189 + 0.008 = 0.197. 
				
		\item
		
		What is the estimated probability of a woman with a fat intake of 100 grams per day being in the high cholesterol group? 
		
		The estimated probability of a woman with a fat intake of 100 grams per day being in the high cholestrol group is -0.130 + 0.189 * 0 + 0.008 * 100 = 0.67.
		\item
		Would the answers to 2a and 2b potentially change if we included the interaction term in this model? Why? 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Perform a test to see if including an interaction is appropriate.
		\end{itemize}
	
			\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=62, lastline=64]{PS6_Answers.R}  
			
		Based on the output, the p-value of the coefficient for the interaction term is 0.272. Since this is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the coefficient is 0, meaning that there is no significant interaction between the two explanatory variables that the answers to 2a and 2b change drastically
%		\item
%		If you consider all people who have a given fat intake, how does changing from being a female to a male change the odds on being in the high cholesterol group? (For additive model)

\section*{Question 2 (50 points): Political Economy}
\vspace{.25cm}
\noindent We are interested in how governments' management of public resources impacts economic prosperity. Our data come from \href{https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Adam_Przeworski/publication/240357392_Classifying_Political_Regimes/links/0deec532194849aefa000000/Classifying-Political-Regimes.pdf}{Alvarez, Cheibub, Limongi, and Przeworski (1996)} and is labelled \texttt{gdpChange.csv} on GitHub. The dataset covers 135 countries observed between 1950 or the year of independence or the first year forwhich data on economic growth are available ("entry year"), and 1990 or the last year for which data on economic growth are available ("exit year"). The unit of analysis is a particular country during a particular year, for a total $>$ 3,500 observations. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	Response variable: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{GDPWdiff}: Difference in GDP between year $t$ and $t-1$. Possible categories include: "positive", "negative", or "no change"
	\end{itemize}
	\item
	Explanatory variables: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		\texttt{REG}: 1=Democracy; 0=Non-Democracy
		\item
		\texttt{OIL}: 1=if the average ratio of fuel exports to total exports in 1984-86 exceeded 50\%; 0= otherwise
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{itemize}

\noindent Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Construct and interpret an unordered multinomial logit with \texttt{GDPWdiff} as the output and "no change" as the reference category, including the estimated cutoff points and coefficients.
				\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=72, lastline=77]{PS6_Answers.R}  
	
	The coefficient REG for countries with a GDP decrease is 3.972, while the coefficient is 5.865 for countries with GDP growth. Therefore, democratic countries are more likely to have GDP growth than undemocratic ones. On the other hand, coefficient OIL for countries with a GDP decrease is 119.578, while the coefficient is 97.156 for countries with positive GDP growth. Therefore, countries that export on average more than half of their exports in fuel are more likely to have a decrease in GDP
	
	\item Construct and interpret an ordered multinomial logit with \texttt{GDPWdiff} as the outcome variable, including the estimated cutoff points and coefficients.
				\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=83, lastline=85]{PS6_Answers.R}  
				
	For countries that are democratic, the odds of having positive GDP growth is 1.507 times greater than for countries that are not democratic. For countries that export more than 50\% of total export in oil, the odds of having positive GDP growth is 0.836 times greater than for countries that export less than 50\%.
